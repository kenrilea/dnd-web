The target must succeed on a Wisdom\nsaving throw or follow the command on its next turn. The\nspell has no effect if the target is undead, if it doesn't\nunderstand your language, or if your command is directly\nharmful to it.\nSome typical commands and their effects follow. You\nmight issue a command other than one described here. If\nyou do so, the GM determines how the target behaves. If\nthe target can't follow your command, the spell ends.\nApproach. The target moves toward you by the shortest\nand most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5\nfeet of you.\nDrop. The target drops whatever it is holding and then\nends its turn\nFlee. The target spends its turn moving away from you by\nthe fastest available means\nGrovel. The target falls prone and then ends its turn.\nHalt. The target doesn't move and takes no actions. A\nflying creature stays aloft, provided that it is able to do so.\nIf it must move to stay aloft, it flies the minimum distance\nneeded to remain in the air.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell\nslot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect one additional\ncreature for each slot level above 1st.
