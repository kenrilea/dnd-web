Each humanoid in a 20-foot-radius sphere\ncentered on a point you choose within range must make a\nCharisma saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this\nsaving throw if it wishes. If a creature fails its saving\nthrow, choose one of the following two effects.\nYou can suppress any effect causing a target to be\ncharmed or frightened. When this spell ends, any\nsuppressed effect resumes, provided that its duration has\nnot expired in the meantime.\nAlternatively, you can make a target indifferent about\ncreatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. This\nindifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a\nspell or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed.\nWhen the spell ends, the creature becomes hostile again,\nunless the GM rules otherwise\n","save":"Charisma"}
